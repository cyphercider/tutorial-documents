# Beginner's Guide to Graph Database Schema Design

## What is a graph?
A graph has two elements: vertices and edges.  A vertex is an entity, and an edge is a relationship between two entities.
## What is a triple?
A triple is a 3-word statement that specifies a single relationship (edge) between two entities (vertices).  As an example: Bob and Samantha are both entities.  The 3-word statement: "Bob" "knows" "Samantha" specifies that the entity "Bob" is related to "Samantha" in that he "knows" her.  In a graph, "Bob" and "Samantha" are both vertices, and "knows" is an edge connecting "Bob" to "Samantha"
